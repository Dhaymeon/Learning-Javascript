// Variable names should not be reserved keywords.
// They must be meaningful.
// They cannot start with a number.
// They cannot contain a space or hyphen.
// They are case-sensitive - firstName is not FirstName.
// You can declare variables on one line separated with commas
// The best way to decalare a variable is using a single line format
